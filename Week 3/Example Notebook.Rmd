#sandbox to run local tests

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r,mychunk-local,message=FALSE}
library(devtools); #required for source_url()
my.source = 'local';

local.path = "C:/Users/Connor/.ssh/stats419/";
source( paste0(local.path,"Functions/libraries.R") );
source( paste0(local.path,"Functions/functions-imdb.R") );

#source("Functions/libraries.R");
#source("Functions/libraries.R");

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
