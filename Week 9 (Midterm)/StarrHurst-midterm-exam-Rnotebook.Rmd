## TESTING PROCEDURE
 
This midterm exam (Rnotebook-midterm) is worth 150 points.  For each question, review how much the item is worth in terms of points and plan your time wisely. 

I would deem it "unwise" to spend hours on a question that is only worth 5 points.

### Static/Existing Resources Are Allowed
 
This is an open-book examination.  You can use your course notebooks (digital and old-school). You can use Internet resources (stackoverflow, Wikipedia, and Youtube).  

### Dynamic/Living Resources Are _ **NOT**_  Allowed

**You cannot use a living resource on the exam.**  That would include a classmate, student, sibling, parent, a tutor, online forums (where you ask the question after the exam period has begun). 

If you have questions that need clarifying, please **email the instructor** and he will try to answer them by email or ZOOM.  He will be checking his email often during the week of the exam, to make himself available to you.

### Levels of Mastery

* Do You **Remember**?
* Do You **Understand**?
* Can You **Apply** what you remember/understand to another similar problem?
* Can You **Analyze** and **Synthesize** Data?
* Can You **Evaluate** your analyses?
* Can You **Create** meaningful visualizations and summaries?  

### Rubric of Mastery 
 
For every 10 points, this is the general breakdown.
 
| Emerging       | Developing     | Mastering    |
| :------------- | :----------:   | -----------: |

# EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing data to summarize its main characteristics.

Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) is the process of applying specific statistical methods to analyze the data.  The goal is also to summarize its main characteristics.  We commonly refer to CDA as "statistical hypothesis testing". CDA generally makes assumptions about how the data is distributed. Or wants to apply a specific model to the data.

So the 2 approaches have the same objective: summarize the main characteristics of the data. How they achieve that objective is very different.  

## Introduction 

### John Tukey
John Tukey is the father of "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey>.  My favorite statistics book is his 1977 book (not surprising) entitled "Exploratory Data Analysis."

### Exploratory vs Confirmatory
From Wikipedia (Accessed October 2020):  Tukey "also contributed to statistical practice and articulated the important distinction between exploratory data analysis and confirmatory data analysis, **believing that much statistical methodology placed too great an emphasis on the latter**."

I belong to the "Tukey" camp. I believe too much emphasis is place on "formal statistical methods and tests".  I believe more emphasis should be placed on the underlying nature of the data.  These underlying principles are how the statistical methods developed.  

As a data analyst, I believe that first and foremost, we should let the data speak.  That is why the first half of the semester started in this form.  The second half (confirmatory data analysis) will rely on what is labeled by many as "formal statistical methods".

### Tukey and "Bell Labs"

In 1965, Tukey divided his time between working at Princeton University and working at Bell Labs (a research think tank).  

#### Robust Statistics as Nonparametric

Tukey proposed that five summary data are essential to understanding numerical data:  `min`, `max`, `median` (technically `Q2`), and `Q1` and `Q3` (the quartiles).  In `R`, the function `summary` has only added `mean` to Tukey's proposal from years ago.

#### Box and Whisker Plot 

In 1975, Tukey invented the "box and whisker" plot that identifies the median, inter-quartile range (IQR), and outliers of data.  The visualization displays the data without making any assumptions about its statistical distribution.  The boxplot is a working demonstration of EDA.  **Let the data speak!**

### John Chambers and `S` and `R`
At the same time as John Tukey, three other men were also working at Bell Labs (John Chambers, Rick Becker, and Allan Wilks) on a statistical programming language `S` that emphasized EDA.  This "statistical computing" language was programming mostly in `Fortran` with some `C` programming.    Chambers published his first "statistical computing" text in 1977, titled "Computational methods for data analysis" <https://archive.org/details/computationalmet0000cham/page/n11/mode/2up>

Between 1988 and 1991, Chambers updated the engine of `S` to make it more robust.  That same engine still powers much of `R` today.  That is, much of the base code of `S` was written by Chambers himself. `R` today still uses much of that `S` codebase under the hood.  

`R` was an open-source offshoot (a "fork") of `S` which occurred in the mid 1990s.  Today, Chambers is still active in the `S`-now`R` community.  My favorite book of his is titled (2008): "Software for data analysis programming with R".  My second-favorite book of his is titled (1998): "Programming with data: a guide to the S language".  In 2016, he authored another book that I still need to read "Extending R."  

Modern `R` is written in `Fortran`, `C`, and `C++`.  

Since its foundation is primarily `C`, we can use standard "make" and "make-install" tools to compile R or its packages from the source code.  That is why we needed `Rtools` on Windows.  The MacOS is now linux based, so no additional tools are required.

## Summary

EDA as exploration is an iterative process.  

### Analogy: learning a foreign language
I like to use the analogy of learning a foreign language using the "immersion" approach. For example, I studied Spanish in high school, learned vocabulary and grammar, and really could not speak the language well.  

I did learn to speak the language well by being dropped into a foreign country for nearly two years.  Some key ingredients to learn a language in an "immersive" environment are listed below:  

- surround yourself with others speaking the language to be learned [e.g., I did not spend a lot of time with other Americans speaking English]. 
- be present when engaged in the language.  Listen intently and try to understand as much as you can, not worrying about what you don't fully understand.  

- reflect after language engagement.  Try to synthesize what "gaps" you have and then develop study habits to fill in those gaps.

- practice what you have learned.

To some degree, my success was likely accelerated because I had precursory training.  Regardless, "immersive" practices benefit learning new languages.

### Proficiency in Data Analytics

[As part of your journey, I have asked you to keep a "paper-and-pencil" notebook to write down words/phrases/ideas.  For example, in this section, there may be words/terms/phrases/ideas you don't fully understand.]

Proficiency requires an iteration of these key features described above.  But first, you have to understand what language you are trying to speak.  Is it `R`?  Is it Statistics?  Mathematics?  What exactly is the language?

In my opinion, the language is the "language of data". 

### The "language of data"

How do you think mathematics developed?  It likely started with simple data, based on real-world experience:  two hands, five fingers on each hand gives me the number ten.  Counting in a base-10 system likely resulted.  An entire domain of mathematics called "number theory" devotes its studies to these integer values.

How do you think statistics developed?  People went out and started measuring things.  One person would literally walk down the street in the late 1800s and ask if he could measure a person's proportions.  Another person would study crop yields at different locations and tried to ascertain if they were different. 

The foundation of mathematics and statistics is data. So I believe, we should let the data speak.

### Let the data speak

So I am definitely an EDA-guy.  Some people are, some people are not.  I personally am a strong believer that we should **let the data speak**, learn how to describe the data without imposing any restrictions on it, and always think about the data first and foremost.  

I also believe that we should use logic, intuition, and insight before we develop any formal "confirmatory" hypothesis testing.  I have intentionally architected this course to emphasis EDA.

### Quality data provenance

I am also very ademant about **data provenance** as I believe the "outputs" of any analysis (whether exploratory or confirmatory) is as only as good as the data quality.  I call this `data intimacy`.  You should care just as much about the process to get quality data as you do to analyze said data.

The term **GIGO** (garbage-in, garbage-out) in my estimation represents what happens when care for quality data is treated lightly.  

### Iterative Exploration
This full EDA approach is a multi-lens approach.  View the data from as many different perspectives as possible before arriving at a conclusion.  Base your conclusion on a synthesis of what you analyzed from those different perspectives.

- We do initial EDA (using mathematical foundations), 
- then we may do confirmatory analyses (traditional statistical methods), and 
- then we synthesize our findings and do a higher-ordered EDA using the original analysis and the confirmatory analysis to make final decisions using sound logic and intuition.
- this process will enlighten our understanding and possibly help us formulate new suppositions and think about what additional data would inform the topic.

## (10 points) YOUR "EDA" OPINION 

I have expressed my opinion about the study of data and the importance of EDA in that study.  What is your opinion on this topic?

This is worth 10 points, a minimal answer should be at least 3 paragraphs. Agreeing/Disagreeing with my opinion is not how you will be evaluated.  How well you express YOUR opinion is what is important.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

I think Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and  Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) both play an important part when it comes to studying data. EDA makes an effort to summarize data as a whole, without making changes to the data. Additionally, we don't have to make hypotheses or speculate what the data is trying to tell us with Exploratory Data Analysis because it organizes all the data in a simple form and allows us to extract exact information.

CDA is all about making theories and trying to confirm them with the trends in data. Occasionally, minor changes are made (like removing outliers) to make the data more understandable. Which I disagree with unless a piece of data was purposely made incorrect. Most of the time confirmatory analysis only gives us a percentage of how much the data supports a hypothesis. Though this can be very helpful information to find tendencies in a dataset, it lacks concrete results as we constantly have to calculate confidence intervals and amounts of error.

In my opinion, EDA is a way of looking at data in a more natural and unchanged state. Allowing us to gather direct and confirmed information from the data. But CDA is more about bending the data to our will and reforming it to show how wrong or correct our theories are. It merely shows how much (or how little) a theory is supported by the data. If I had a choice between EDA and CDA, I would always choose EDA because I can gather specific information from the data that I know is true. I think an exploratory analysis should always be done, but a confirmatory analysis should not always be done.

## SIMULATING DATA 
### (10 points) Basic Simulation 

- Pick a `set.seed` choice so the code is replicable.  Verify that every time you run the commands, the data is not changing with the seed "you chose".
- Use the functions `rnorm`, `runif` to simulate data.  
- Simulate `n=9999;` data for each.  
- Call `x.rnorm` the data for the first and `x.runif` the data for the second.  
- Plot a histogram `graphics::hist` and report the summary statistics ``base::summary` of each. 
- Then, plot them using `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);`.  
- Finally, `plot(x.rnorm, sample(x.rnorm));` and compare it to `plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif));`.  

#### Code of simulation
```{r, chunk-simulating-rnorm-runif, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
set.seed(1921);

x.rnorm = rnorm(9999, mean=0, sd=1); #normal dist
x.runif = runif(9999, min=0, max=1); #uniform dist

#plot(x.rnorm);
hist(x.rnorm);
summary(x.rnorm);

#plot(x.runif);
hist(x.runif);
summary(x.runif);

plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);

par(mfrow=c(1,2));
plot(x.rnorm, sample(x.rnorm));
plot(x.runif, sample(x.runif));
```

#### **Describe `rnorm`, `runif`**

- Describe what each function `rnorm` and `runif` does. How are they similar?  How are they different?  
- What does the `sample` function do?
- How was `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);` different from `plot(x.rnorm, ( x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm) ) );` and `plot(x.runif, ( x.runif.sample = sample(x.runif) ) );`?  How would you describe the shape of each of these plots?

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

`rnorm` creates a random normal distribution given a desired sample size (n), mean (default mean=0), and standard deviation (default sd=1). `runif` creates a random uniform distribution given a desired sample size (n), lower limit (default min=0), and upper limit (default max=1). Both functions create a random distribution of size n, but `rnorm` uses a mean and standard deviation to create values, while `runif` uses a lower and upper limit to create equally likely values.
`sample` takes a sample or subset, of a specified size, from a set of data.
The points in `plot(x.rnorm, x.runif);` had a wide vertical trend, while `plot(x.rnorm, ( x.rnorm.sample = sample(x.rnorm) ) );` had a centralized circular grouping of points, and `plot(x.runif, ( x.runif.sample = sample(x.runif) ) );` had points completely filling the rectangular graph with no discernible pattern.

### (5 points) "Easter-Egg" Simulation 

- There was an "Easter Egg" that related to setting the seed `set.seed` using `rbinom`.  If you search in the BlackBoard discussion forum for `easter` you will see the discussion about August 25-27.
- In the "Easter Egg", the goal was to find a scenario using a specific `set.seed` that would simulate flipping a coin 100 times and getting one result (heads/tails) exactly 52 times. 
- In this problem, the search criteria has changed. Simulate flipping a coin 1000 times and getting one result (heads/tails) exactly 555 times. 
- You need to report 5 values for `set.seed` that achieves this objective. You can report more.  
- You should explicitly have the code print `length(x)` where `x` is a vector of the values that meet the objective.

```{r, chunk-simulating-rbinom, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
numSimulations = 1:100000; #run 100,000 simulations
seedNum = 0; #seed number
x = numeric(0); #create a vector to hold seeds (vector of values that meet the objective)

for(i in numSimulations) #run through every seed between 1 and 100,000
{
  set.seed(i); #set the current seed
  result = rbinom(1, 1000, .5); #do 1000 50% probabilities (1000 coin flips)
  
  if(result == 555) #if the seed results in 555 of heads/tails, add it our vector x
  {
    seedNum = seedNum+1; #increment to next seed
    x = c(x, i); #insert current valid seed into vector of valid seeds
  }
}

print(x); #print vector of values
print(length(x)); #print number of values in the vector
```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

See code comments for explanation, but the code is self explanatory.

### Rolling the Dice

- You have 3 dice.
- Each dice has the numbers `1:10` ... they are ten-sided die ("decader" die).
- Write the necessary `for-loops` to capture all possible outcomes of rolling the three dice at the same time.
- A dataframe `myrolls` should have three columns: `dice.1`, `dice.2`, `dice.3` plus a fourth column `roll.total` which is the sum `dice.1 + dice.2 + dice.3` of one iteration of the nested `for loop`.
- Report the dimensions `dim` of `myrolls`.
- Create a table `outcomes.table` that summarizes the counts of the `myrolls$roll.total` 
- Transform the table to a dataframe `outcomes.df`. Name the columns: c("roll.total", "count");
- Report the sum of `outcome.df$count`
- Create a new column `outcomes.df$prob` (Probability) that determines the probability of that row given the total sum of the `count` column.
- Display the dataframe.

#### Setting Up the Dice Scenario 
```{r, chunk-simulating-dice, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## your code goes here ...

dice.1 = dice.2 = dice.3 = 1:10; #3 ten-sided dice

myrolls = NULL;
for(d1 in dice.1) #loop through each result of dice 1
  {
  for(d2 in dice.2) #loop through each result of dice 2
    {
    for(d3 in dice.3) #loop through each result of dice 3
      {
      roll.total = d1 + d2 + d3; #sum each of the roles
      row = c(d1, d2, d3, roll.total); #create a vector row containing the results of each roll and the sum
      myrolls = rbind(myrolls, row); #append the vector row to a matrix containing all possible results
      }
    }
  }

myrolls = as.data.frame(myrolls); #convert the matrix of results to a dataframe
colnames(myrolls) = c("dice.1", "dice.2", "dice.3", "roll.total"); #change the col names

myrolls;
print("Dimensions of myrolls:"); #Report the dimensions of myrolls
dim(myrolls);

outcomes.table = table(myrolls$roll.total); #table that sums the roll totals
outcomes.df = as.data.frame(outcomes.table); #convert the table to a dataframe
colnames(outcomes.df) = c("roll.total", "count"); #rename the cols 

total.sum = sum(outcomes.df$count); #sum the number of outcomes
print("Sum of outcomes.df$count"); #Report the sum of outcome.df$count
total.sum;

outcomes.df$prob = outcomes.df$count / total.sum; #create a new column containing the probability of a each roll
outcomes.df;
```
#### Viewing a subset of data to answer a question  

- How many ways can I roll a 23 when I throw the dice at the same time?  What is the probability that I roll a 23 on a single throw?

```{r, chunk-simulating-dice-subset-a, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
# if you don't have the latest version of humanVerseWSU, you can access the function as follows:

sub.myrolls = subsetDataFrame(myrolls, "roll.total", "==", 23); #subset myrolls to only contain roll sums that equal 23
sub.myrolls;

sub.outcomes.df = subsetDataFrame(outcomes.df, "roll.total", "==", 23); #subset outcomes to only contain roll sums that equal 23
sub.outcomes.df;
```

## INITIAL EXPLORATION OF REAL DATA

We are going to use exploratory techniques to examine some Indeed.com data.  If you recall, this `job` data examines how many jobs reference a certain keyword.  Every Monday morning at 12:00:00AM EST (using a scheduler `crontab`), this data collection is performed.  A few weeks ago, I added some new keys words.  The data set we have consists of 5 weeks:  `2020-38` to `2020-42`.

- For each "search phrase", I go to Indeed.com and download the first page of results.  
- From this first page, I grab the "total count"
- An example is shown in a screenshot, taken this week.

#### Is "Microsoft Office" bigger than "C++"?

I use the term "bigger" or "better" intentionally.  We are comparing two items, and these are generic ways of communicating such a comparison.  In context of this data problem, a formalized form of the question would be something like:  "Utilizing job count for a given search query, determine if the query 'Microsoft Office' has a larger job count than the query 'C++'?"  This question will need to be formalized if we are trying to draw specific conclusions, but the initiation of analysis "which is bigger" allows us to understand what the data says or does not say, through exploration.  

To answer the question:

Mathematically, if two lines are parallel, and one is above the other, can we use **distance** to draw a conclusion?  Now, many times in statistics we deal with noise in the data, it is not "deterministic" but "stochastic" ... so we need to understand the variability.  Based on the data we see, can we not use  "parallel-line" logic to conclude that they are different?  This is one dimension of EDA, use mathematics. ("mathematics")

```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-microsoft, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

do.nothing = plotJobs(jobs.subset, myy.lim = c(80,250) );

boxplotJobQueryComparison(jobs.subset, "Microsoft Office", "C++");
```
Tukey invented the boxplot as a nice EDA representation of the data.  What logical inference can we make about the distances between the boxplots and the fact that no data is overlapping.  This is another dimension of EDA, use "distance" and the boxplot "IQR" to compare two elements.  What conclusion would we make? ("boxplot")

[Can we conclude the data are different based on "mathematics" or "boxplot"?

Would a formal "inferential statistical test" tell us something different than logical inference?  

How do you think "formal tests" were derived if not from "mathematics" and "boxplot" (EDA)?]

```{r, chunk-plotting-jobs-trends-microsoft-answer, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

# courage in trusting your intuition may require a fall-back ... for those that need it ...

```

For this data, I can descriptively report that the third-quartile `Q3` of "Statistics" is about equal to the `median` of "Java".  The inter-quartile range (`IQR`) of each overlap.  The minimum value of "Java" is larger than the minimum value of "Statistics".  The maximum value of "Java" is slightly smaller than the maximum value of "Statistics".

[Use "mathematics" and "boxplot" and "ttest" to make a conclusion.  

Next, think carefully about the nature of the data.  Is the "collection-approach" flawed to make a conclusion comparing job-counts of these specific keywords? How likely is it that a single-job posting may have both keywords?

This is an example where "data-integrity" knowledge would surpass the other three logical conclusions.

This intuition requires an understanding of what mathematicians call "set theory".  If I am doing an independent search on keywords, is it possible that one job would show up in multiple searches.  That is, being counted twice or more. 

Intuition and logic would also allow us to conclude that our other comparisons are "very likely okay".  Why?

What would be an improved approach to collecting the data that would allow me to more accurately compare these two keywords?

This is representative of why exploratory data analysis is essential.  It provides us insight into the domain and highlights the need for better data, if we can find it.

### Conclusions on logical inference

Distance is a fundamental unit of comparison.  We can use our "mathematical" understanding of distance.  We can use an "EDA" understanding of the data (e.g., the boxplot).  We need to understand the data sourcing and how that will relate to the logical conclusions we are trying to draw. 

When we transition to "confirmatory inferential statistics", we cannot leave our understanding of "maths" and "EDA" behind.  They are the foundation from which "inferential statistics" is built.  They are "logical inference".

## COMPUTING DISTANCES

If you recall, we had a notebook on collecting data from Wikipedia.  We documented the "data-provenance" protocols to make this happen.  We have documented and can replicate our data-collection strategies.

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

### (10 points) Data Provenance defined

Imagine you are preparing for a job interview. Write a 90-second blurb describing "what is data provenance" and "why it matters". I would suggest the STAR(S) approach mentioned in one of the notebooks. Reference the "Wikipedia" project as an example of how one can implement the features. 

What is data provenance?

Probably about 200-250 words (with the 90 second limit)

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

Data provenance is the recording and documentation of the history and origin of a specific set of data. This style of record-keeping tracks all changes made to a data set. Whether it be adding functions, removing functions, changing locations, or improving previous processes. It is a good way to keep versions of a data set. Data provenance is also important for tracing back errors that occur during the processing of the data.

I always try and make use of data provenance. It is easy to do and can be very helpful. I recently did a project where I parsed information from Wikipedia. I parsed populations of state capitals to be displayed on a US map. Data provenance was useful here because I was able to keep a sort of "version history" of my changes and usage of the data. This way I could go back and make changes at any time. It was especially helpful if I ran into any major bugs because I could look at my most recent changes from the previous version. This cut down the amount of time spent on debugging the data.

### Geospatial distances

"Geo-spatial" studies are becoming much more common in the "data analytics" community, so let's use basic "latitude/longitude" data to formally talk about "distance."

So we will look at the 50 state capitals of America (USA).  Before that, let's examine some basic principles of distances using my hometown.

### (5 points) Distance from one input to multiple outputs

#### My Hometown "Columbia Falls, Montana" `cfalls`

- Find all ZIP codes within 22 miles of Columbia Falls, MT `cfalls` (use lat/long provide from the Wikipedia lookup)... build the bounding "box" and perform the post-hoc "radial distance" computations (as we did in the homework).

```{r, chunk-distances-compute-cfalls, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

# copy/paste __student_access__/_SECRET_/_SECRET_database_.txt into console or this won't work

cfalls.latitude = 48.37028;

my.radius = 22; my.units = "mi"; #miles

# THIS is where these exam functions live ...
# source_url( paste0(path.github,"misc/functions-midterm-F2000.R") );  # should be 2020 ... oh well

cfalls.info$neighbors;

my.nearby.states = c("idaho", "washington", "oregon");

plotNeighbors(cfalls.info, 
                    state          = my.state, 
                    state.color    = my.state.color,
                    state.border   = 0.05,

                    nearby.states  = my.nearby.states); 
```

- why is the box not a square, but a rectangle? ... see `factor.lat` and `factor.long` in function `buildBoundingBoxFromRadiusAndGivenLatitudeLongitude`
- critique the visualization ... what do you like? what would make it better?

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

The box isn't square because the factor.lat (latitude factor) and factor.long (longitude factor) are different values (68.703 and 69.172). I like how the county of Columbia Falls, MT is marked differently from each of the found ZIP codes. I would change the square to be a circle to give a more accurate representation of 22 miles away from Columbia Falls and leave the outlines of neighboring counties to give a sense of scale.

#### Your Hometown of something like it
Instead of `cfalls.info`, you do `hometown.info` 

- a location in the continental US of your choosing (not in Montana, Alaska, or Hawaii). [Graphing will not work for Alaska/Hawaii, Alaska has "boroughs" not counties.]
- find the latitude/longitude of the location you have selected (how and where to look that up?)
- Initially start with a radius of `13 miles`
- When you run the code, note how many total "neighbors"; if it is less than 20; increase the "miles" so at least 20 results are returned.
- In the end, you should select a location and radius that works for you. And its visualization also works.
- Be certain to review and update the parameters before calling these functions.

#### (5 points) Comparing "Visualization Options"

Above, the data was displayed using three different visualization packages.

The first `plot_usmap` uses the `ggplot2` methodology which is tied to the "tidyverse" landscape of the `R` community.

The second `voronoi.mosaic` uses the graph-theory topology known as Voroni partitioning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram> with the "base" plot function to visualize the topology.

The last one `map` is from the "base" environment.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

The ggplot2 is most appealing to me because I can see each state and where each capital is compared to the entire US and other states. If the scale of the US map in the base environment map was a large as the US maps in ggplot2 and voroni.mosaic, I would say it would present it the data most effectively due to how simple it is, but I'm going to go with ggplot2 again because of the small size and because there is no Hawaii or Alaska. It is absolutely essential to portray the data accurately. Otherwise you are presenting misinformation or something people do not understand. For that example, I would want them in their actual geological location, because I have heard of people who actually think Hawaii or Alaska are south of California. The key factor would be your audience. If you showing this to children or people who do not know the geography of the US, make sure Hawaii or Alaska are in the correct locations. If your audience knows the geography of the US, it's probably ok to put them close to California.

</pre>

Visually, which is the most appealing to you?  Why?

Functionally, which presents the data most effectively? Why?

When we create visualizations, it is essential to portray the data accurately.  For example, there are times when putting Alaska/Hawaii next to California might be appropriate, and other times it might not be.

What is a one key factor that would determine this appropriateness?

Let's start with geo-spatial distances.  I will do `distMeeus` and you will do `distHaversine`

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

##### **Meeus**
These distance formulas can utilize the true geo-spatial coordinates.  The distance table is getting large, so there is a helper function to lookup a certain value.

```{r, chunk-distances-meeus, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(geosphere);
library(measurements);

dist.meeus = conv_unit(  distm( latlong[,3:4],
                  fun=distMeeus),  "m", "mi");  # default meters to miles

dist.meeus.m = as.matrix( dist.meeus );
  rownames(dist.meeus.m) = 
  colnames(dist.meeus.m) = myLabels;

dist.meeus.df = as.data.frame( round( dist.meeus.m, digits=1) );

dist.meeus.df;  ## too big

lookupPairwiseValue(dist.meeus.df, "Juneau, AK", "Montgomery, AL");
```
<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

##### **Haversine**
```{r, chunk-distances-haversine, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(geosphere);
library(measurements);

dist.haversine = conv_unit(  distm( latlong[,3:4],
                  fun=distHaversine),  "m", "mi");  # default meters to miles

dist.haversine.m = as.matrix( dist.haversine );
  rownames(dist.haversine.m) = 
  colnames(dist.haversine.m) = myLabels;

dist.haversine.df = as.data.frame( round( dist.haversine.m, digits=1) );

dist.haversine.df;  ## too big

lookupPairwiseValue(dist.haversine.df, "Juneau, AK", "Montgomery, AL");
```

You can compare the two with the code below (currently in comments).

```{r, chunk-distances-haversine-comparison, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = dist.meeus.df[,2]; # Juneau ... pick one location
y = dist.haversine.df[,2];

my.lim = c(0, 4000 );

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

There is little difference between these two calculations. distMeeus calculates the shortest distance between two points on an ellipsoid. distHaversine calculates the shortest distance between two points on a spherical earth, ignoring ellipsoidal effects. The results are similar, there's only a difference of 1. I don't know of any by name, but a more accurate distance algorithm would be one that maps the distance of the physical terrain. (unless you're exclusively traveling by air with no other planes getting in the way)

</pre>

Examining the data above, is there much difference between these two calculations? 

What is the conceptual difference between these two calculations?  Try `?distMeeus` or `?distHaversine`

Are the results similar?

Is there a more accurate distance algorithm for geo-spatial calculations?  If so, what is it?

We have converted the true latitude/longitude to a miles-type format, so the resulting table will report miles.

dist.euclidean = dist( latlong[,1:2],

Manhattan returns a distance of 4418 while Euclidean returns a distance of 3179.8, which is a difference of 1,238.2 miles. The results are not similar

## HIERARCHICAL clustering as a function of distance

Aggregating or agglomerating data is typically called "clustering" and is generally considered to be a "unsupervised learning" method.

### Introduction
We use `hclust` to perform Hierarchical Clustering.  The word "hierarchical" is used because the nature of the data is organized like a family genealogy.  The bottom of the tree represents the descendants that eventually "link" to a common ancestor.

If you type `?hclust` you can review the parameter options which we explored in a notebook.  `hclust` is primarily a function of `dist()` [distance], and we have just computed some distances, so we could try and apply `hclust` to our data to see if our state capitals will cluster into meaningful regions.

There are several agglomeration methods ("linkage") one could choose from.  Each method takes the `dist` <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Metric> and performs some pairwise distance algorithm called a linkage criteria <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_clustering#Linkage_criteria>.

I generally use either the "complete" linkage method or the "ward.D2" linkage method.  You can read help `?hclust` to better appreciate why: "A number of different clustering methods are provided. Ward's minimum variance method aims at finding compact, spherical clusters. The complete linkage method finds similar clusters."

If you are trying to link binary data (zeroes and ones) or genomic data (where the distances were computed using a genetic-distance algorithm), you may want to try the UPGMA approach: "average" or "centroid".  

### Analogy of Family

Since I am from a large family, I will make a family tree analogy.  For me, I am the 5th of 11 siblings (5 brothers, 5 sisters).  If I wanted to cluster the siblings in a pair-wise fashion, how would I begin?

First, I would ask, which other sibling is most like me?  Since this is a pair-wise approach, and there are 11 siblings, maybe at the initial stage, I will not be paired with another sibling.

In fact, at least one will not be paired because the total number is 11.  And maybe more than one will not be paired in the initial stage.  Remember "similarity" is being defined based on some distance-linkage method.  And to use this approach, "similarity" needs to numerical data.

At each stage, pair-wise joining occurs until there is nothing left to join.  The tree contains all of the elements.  Every element (branch) eventually joins the main branch (trunk) of the tree.  

### Clustering U.S. capital cities based on latitude, longitude

We already have some data for the U.S. capitals and have computed a Euclidean distance using a capital-city's longitude and latitude.  Let's choose to cut the result into `12` agglomerations.  Why 12?  It was a choice based on my life experience and intuition.  As I reflected on why, I did some external searching that validates a choice in that range <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_regions_of_the_United_States>.  You certainly could run this analysis with another choice  It is exploratory, and your intuition matters.

Geographically, I am saying the capital-city does represent the state.  An ideal representation may be in the center (centroid) of the state.  Remember this when we see the linkages with "New York", the city is Albany, not Manhattan.

```{r, chunk-distances-hclust-euclidean, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## ward.D2
hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean = hclust(dist.euclidean, method="ward.D2");

plot( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, 
      labels= myLabels );
rect.hclust( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12 );

# complete
# hclust.complete.dist.euclidean = hclust(dist.euclidean, method="complete");

# plot( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean,
#       labels= myLabels );
# rect.hclust( hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12 );
```

### Understanding the `cutree`

In the above example, the tree was cut into 12 groups based on the "distance" formula used and based on the "agglomeration" linkage technique invoice. I likely should have used a "geo-spatial" distance, but we will see that mere "euclidean" distance seems to perform okay.  

A fancy word for this statistical tree is a "dendrogram".  I call each element of the tree a branch. The smallest branches (twigs) are the fundamental elements, in this case the cities.  Over time, they merge with other small branches, and so on.

The relative height when this smallest branch merges with another branch demonstrates when the branch has found a similar pair-wise match (with another smallest branch or a merging branch). I call "Honolulu Hawaii" an isolate because the vertical height when it merges with another branch is the highest of all of the smallest branches (e.g., cities). "Juneau Alaska" is another isolate, but it does merge before "Hawaii".

It would be nice if we could decompose this information and look at one `cutree` at a time.  And color-code the distinctions. Using the function `plot.hclust.sub` we can do this.

```{r, chunk-distances-hclust-euclidean-sub, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

source_url( paste0(path.github,"humanVerseWSU/R/functions-EDA.R") );  # EDA functions ...

hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean$labels = myLabels;
plot.hclust.sub(hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean, k=12);

#plot.hclust.sub(hclust.complete.dist.euclidean, k=12);
```

### (10 points) Review one clustering tree (dendrogram)

Choose either `hclust.ward2.dist.euclidean` or `hclust.complete.dist.euclidean` and review how the U.S. state capitals are clustered.  [I commented out one form, so you will have to re-run if you want to select that one.]

Comment on the "face validity" of this approach based on your understanding about how the U.S. regions are defined?  Are the North/South Dakotas together? What about the North/South Carolinas?  What about the Pacific Northwest?  While living in Kentucky, some people called the area "Kentuckiana" meaning Kentucky/Indiana.  Does that show up? Also note anything that seems peculiar.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

This approach is mostly accurate. The North/South Dakotas are together, the North/South Carolinas are also together. The Pacific Northwest is mostly together (missing Idaho). Kentucky/Indiana are together as well. Strangely, Montana, Idaho, and Utah were grouped instead of being grouped with their easter or southern bordered states.

</pre>

### Additional remarks about `hclust`

I find `hclust` to be a nice initial perusal of the data.  

If you want to understand the stability of a particular `hclust` to use it for something other than an "initial perusal of the data," I would recommend `pvclust` which I introduced in the weekly notebooks.  It is often used in peer-reviewed research, as it provides a `p-value` of sorts regarding the **stability** of the `hclust` structure.

## GENERIC clustering 
Aggregating or agglomerating data is typically called "clustering".  In exploration, we can create some generic clustering techniques.  Below we will create two adhoc clustering rules.

### Arbitrary Aggregation

Recall the "movie dataset" with "Will Smith" and "Denzel Washington".  We have a collection of movies, and how much money each movie made at the box office.  We could organize those movies by some arbitrary rules.  For example:

- Cluster 1:  NA.  We have missing data regarding the money. So let's put all movies that are NA into that cluster.
- Cluster 2:  Under a million dollars
- Cluster 3:  1-4.99... million dollars (greater than or equal to one, but less than 5)
- Cluster 4:  5-49.99... 
- Cluster 5:  50+

### Aggregating using Quantiles

John Tukey emphasized that ordering the data and then splitting it based on the ordering was a fundamental premise of exploratory data analysis.  

#### Tukey's Summary Data

John Tukey proposed five elements as primary data for analysis.

- the minimum `min`
- the maximum `max`

Sorting the data makes it easiest to find these data, and will be useful to find the other three exploratory summary features.

This is what I would call "slice and dice".  The data is cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting point" is the `Q2` which we call the `median`.

Next, the lower half could also be cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting" point is `Q1`.

Then, the upper half could also be cut in half, and the value of that middle "cutting" point is `Q3`.

A common metric derived from this "median-split" procedure is called the interquartile range `IQR` which is defined as the distance between `Q3` and `Q1`.  It literally represents the middle 50% of the data; 50% of the elements of the dataset are between `Q3` and `Q1`.  

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

#### Quartile Example 
```{r, chunk-quartiles, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = 1:99;
length(x);

median(x);
x[50];

median(x[1:49]);
x[25];

median(x[51:99]);
x[75];

# probability-approach ... 
# algorithm: the default type=7
stats::quantile(x, prob = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), type=1);
```

Algorithms address various issues associated with dividing numbers and whether or not to include the dividing number in the subset division, but the principle holds.

We can generalize this idea by not always cutting the data in half (median-split as `n=2`, median-median-split as `n=4`).  Instead, we could cut by tens (we call them deciles).  Or we could cut by hundreds (we call them centiles).  The function `quantile` performs this operation, and if you dig into the `doStatsSummary` function used in this course, you can see its application.

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

#### (5 points) Movie Aggregation [Decile] for Will and Denzel

```{r, chunk-aggregate-quantiles, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

## you do something here ... 
# use # stats::quantile(x, prob=seq(0.1,0.9,by=0.1), type=1 );
# (1) how many NA's are there ... keep them NA's
nas = sum(is.na(movies.50));
print("Number of NAs:");
nas;

# (2) for the rest of the data, break it up into deciles
deciles = stats::quantile(movies.50, prob=seq(0.1,1,by=0.1), na.rm = T, type=1 );
print("Deciles:");
deciles;

# (3) $cluster.deciles for a given movie should be NA, 1, 2, 3, ... 10
movies.50$cluster.deciles = deciles;
print("Deciles clusters:");
movies.50$cluster.deciles;

# (4) summarize how many movies live in each (table count)
table(movies.50$cluster.deciles);
```

## CENTROID clustering (k-means) as a function of distance

### Introduction
Rather than clustering on distance-linkage in a pair-wise fashion, we can cluster based on randomly selecting just `k` points in our data and begin identifying their nearest neighbors using some distance approach.

For example, if `k=3`, we would randomly select three of our data points.  We would then compute the distances from all of the remaining points to these `3` anchor points.  The points that are closest to a given anchor will be assigned to that anchor.  At the end of the stage, we now have new data, so a new centroid is determined.  At this point, the centroid <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid> is likely not one of our data points, but a location within the given centroid cluster.  In the "naive" approach, you merely take an average (mean) of all the members of your cluster.  More advanced approaches (the default "Hartigan-Wong" of `kmeans`) utilize deviations from the average, called a sum-of-squares approach.  This is why in our `kmeans-notebook` we analyzed the `wss` to ascertain how many clusters `k` should we use.

Regardless, after the new centroids (centers) for the clusters are determined, the process iterates.  All distances are computed from all points to the new centroids; points are assigned to a given centroid cluster (in this example: 1, 2, 3); a new centroid center is computed, and we repeat the process until a stopping rule is reached: maybe we have exhausted the number of iterations allowed (`iter.max` parameter of `kmeans`)?  Or maybe we are not changing membership of any of the data points?  Or maybe we have met some objective (like `wss`)?

It is possible to get a `kmeans` result by merely starting with `3 different` random points.  In general, `kmeans` is fast (and our computers are so much faster than the computers of 1990: the first computer I built in 1995 had 32MB of RAM, a Pentium processor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium#Pentium> and a 900MB Cheetah hard-drive).

Anyway, we can utilize the parameter `nstart` to try many different starting values, and let the program identify the best, most consistent solution.

### My recommendations

I would recommend the default algorithm `Hartigan-Wong` with `iter.max=100` and `nstart=100`.  You can test the timings from the default values: `iter.max=10` and `nstart=1`.  Since the data is likely multidimensional `stars` are the best way to summarize the results and membership of `kmeans`.  Please see the "kmeans-notebook" for examples.

### WIKIPEDIA CLIMATE DATA

For the 50 U.S. cities, we harvested climate data.  In the "Wikipedia" notebook, details of that data provenance were outlined.  If we want to compare the cities using the climate data, we have to build a matching dataframe, which means we have to select features that exist in each city's climate data set.

There are four temperature features that are always present:

- Record high F (C) ... we will call it "high.max"
- Average high F (C) ... we will call it "high.avg"
- Average low F (C) ... we will call it "low.avg"
- Record low F (C)  ... we will call it "low.max" [probably not the best name choice, but it is parallel in form to the first element]

Additionally, for precipitation we have:

- Average precipitation inches (mm) ... we will call it "rain"
- Average snowfall inches (cm) ... we will call it "snow"

For each of these features we have 12 months of data.  This is a nice dataset.  Let's see what we can do with it.

#### Basic Background Research
We should begin by doing a bit of peripheral research on the topic, to gain "domain knowledge" so we know what to do with the data.  A few elements that would benefit.

#### One Graph

When graphing data to visualize, it is essential that you keep the scales uniform so quick-visual comparisons are accurate.  I gave you a task to practice the idea of creation that "one informative" research graphic.  And I now present my version for you to use and critique based on your efforts.  I am a `plot` guy, so some of you may have a different ``ggplot2` type solution.  Ultimately, the intent of this graphic is to best summarize the data in a meaningful way for exploratory analysis.

I like this graph because (I think) it shows everything at once, is colorful, and quick comparisons can be made. However, there is no legend, so I don't know what each of the colors represents, nor do I know why there is a moon on the chart. Also, I don't think pictures should be used to label certain colors/sections as they are vague. The graphic is aesthetically pleasing and has a lot of nice functionality, but it's not very clear on what each of the sections are. Additionally, if this graph is displaying an amount of rainfall and snowfall for each month, why is it being labeled as temperature? A second label for those would be nice.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

I like this graph because I can compare a lot of climate information between two states. I dislike how squished together the graphs are, it makes them look cramped. It also has the same problems with being vague (like the previous graphic). The y-axis' are the same scale, but the gridlines are not the same for each, and I think they should be to make the graphs look more even. Even though there won't be any data points in the extra gridlines, as a viewer, I know no information is being hidden and each graph is plotted on the exact same scale. I believe rain is labeled with a blue circle and a corresponding number. Snow is labeled with a blue band and snow = # at the ends of the Montana graph. I can't even tell if Louisiana gets snow, let alone how much. I think this is an excellent approach, but as I stated previously, it lacks a legend and smaller points (like snow) should also be labeled with a number for each data point.

##### (5 points) One Publication Graph

We are in exploration, so the "one" research graphic may be very different than the "one" formal graphic designed for a client.  Typically, the final graphic needs to meet certain criteria:

- Very pleasing aesthetically 
- Interactive if possible
- Live data feeds if possible
- Served in a secure, safe, private location (if required by the client)

To demonstrate the differences, I created a mockup of our 50 U.S. cities and put it into a nice finalized product form called "highcharts".  

<http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_EXAMPLES_/fiddle_usmap/>

It pulls data in real time (using AJAX) to grab the weather at the latitudes/longitudes we defined in our Wikipedia notebook.  

- You can use your mouse to draw a box to zoom in.  
- The third-wheel on the mouse also helps you zoom in/out.
- Hold down CNTRL with your left hand and use your mouse key to drag the map.  It seems to only "pan" in the x-direction at the moment.  
- The data in the popup displayed can be customized.  I report the temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit and also display the population data we gathered from Wikipedia. 

Once you have a template built, it is rather easy to modify it.  Here I changed the background map, and all of the data/features stay the same:

<http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_EXAMPLES_/fiddle_usmap/world.html>

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

### Which Features to Include in the Analysis

* months, you can pick all of them `1:12` or maybe just one month per season (April, July, October, January)
* X, depending on what you chose for months, you can now select what climate columns you want to use
  - Some of Temperature Data
  - All of Temperature Data
  - Precipitation Data
  - Everything (All of Temperature Data, Precipitation Data)
  
If we want to cluster cities, which decisions seem best?  Why?  As you can see from the code below, you just comment out two options, and can quickly rerun the analysis.

- WHICH MONTHS
- WHICH COLUMNS

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### WHICH MONTHS & WHICH COLUMNS
```{r, chunk-climate-which-features, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

climate = utils::read.csv( paste0(path.mshaffer, "_data_/state-capitals/final/state-capitals-climatedata.txt"), header=TRUE, quote="", sep="|");

##################### CHOOSE WHICH MONTHS ##############
########################################################
months = 1:12; # all data/months
#months = c(1,4,7,10); # one month from each of the four seasons (January, April, July, October)
########################################################

month.abb;  # ?month.abb (abbreviate the month names to 3 letters)
month.name;

month.name[months];  # these are the names of the months you are selecting

# this function would allow us to use different months as criteria and different climate-data keys. It is variadic and flexible. `key.n` are the names we will use for our new columns

climate.df = buildClimateDataFrame(climate, months, keys=c("Record high F (C)", "Average high F (C)", "Average low F (C)", "Record low F (C)", "Average precipitation inches (mm)", "Average snowfall inches (cm)"), keys.n = c("highmax", "highavg",  "lowavg", "lowmin", "rain", "snow") );

climate.df;
names(climate.df); # this helps you see the indexes

##################### WHICH COLUMNS #####################
#########################################################
#X = climate.df[,5:52]; # temperature
X = climate.df[,5:76];  # everything (includes rain)
#X = climate.df[,5:20]; # temperature, 1 month per season
#X = climate.df[,5:28]; # everything (includes rain), 1 month per season
#########################################################

rownames(X) = climate.df$labels;
Xs = scale(X);
```

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">

### To scale or not to scale, that is the question

```{r, chunk-distances-X-or-Xs, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

X = climate.df[,5:76];  # everything, you have to change months above to get this dataframe to be the correct size, months = 1:12
rownames(X) = climate.df$labels;
Xs = scale(X);
```

So let's do some analysis with all of the data available to us.  Most of the data is in Temperature, with ranges from -42 degrees Fahrenheit (Helena, Montana) to 122 (Phoenix, Arizona).

The precipitation data (rain and snow) is measured in inches.  So should we scale the data.  The answer in PCA and orthogonal projections is absolutely YES, but for `hclust` and `kmeans` is that always the case?

You can make a choice below, and observe how it influences your answers. 

<HR divider="1" style="border: 1px solid #981e32; border-radius: 1px;">
#### WHICH X
```{r, chunk-distances-whichX, cache.rebuild=TRUE}
whichX = X;
#whichX = Xs;
```

<HR divider="5" style="border: 5px solid #981e32; border-radius: 5px;">

### Perform `k-means` on All Climate Features

With the selected features let's perform k-means. Let's select k=12. I will select all of the features, but you can change that if you wish.

#### Descriptives of Sample
```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-setup-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

colors = rainbow(50, s = 0.6, v = 0.75); # 50 colors for 50 states

stars(whichX, len = 0.5, key.loc=c(12,2), draw.segments = TRUE); # descriptive star plot to start

## too busy, let's group them
x.start = 1;
x.end = 10;

for(i in 1:5)
  {
  stars( whichX[x.start:x.end,] , 
          len = 0.5, key.loc=c(6,2), draw.segments = TRUE);
  x.start = 1 + x.end;
  x.end = 10 + x.end;
  }
```

Above, you are just analyzing the general shapes.  Which ones are "fuller" circles?  Why?  

Which ones are not very "full circles"?  Why?

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

I'm not entirely sure, but I think fuller circles have more variation in temperatures. So "fuller" circles have a larger difference between their highest temperatures and lowest temperatures. Not very "full circles" would have less variation implying the temperature doesn't change much over the year.

</pre>

<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

#### Computation of Clusters/Centroids

```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-run-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

k = 12;
iterations = 100;
number.starts = 100;

whichX.kmeans = kmeans(whichX, 12, 
                    iter.max=iterations, 
                    nstart = number.starts);  # default algorithm
stars(whichX.kmeans$centers, len = 0.5, key.loc = c(10, 3),
        main = "Algorithm: DEFAULT [Hartigan-Wong] \n Stars of KMEANS=12", draw.segments = TRUE);
```
<HR divider="2" style="border: 2px solid #981e32; border-radius: 2px;">

#### Cluster Membership and Centroid Attributes

```{r, chunk-distances-kmeans-table-temp, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

membership = matrix( whichX.kmeans$cluster, ncol=1);
membership = membership[order(membership),];
membership = as.data.frame(membership);
        rownames(membership) = climate.df$labels;
        colnames(membership) = c("Cluster");

membership; #show which cluster each state is in

print( table(membership) ) #show how many states are in each cluster

# I believe in an older version of R these were called $centroids
attributes = as.data.frame( whichX.kmeans$centers );
    rownames(attributes) = paste0("Cluster.",1:12);
  attributes; #show average attribute for each cluster
```

#### (10 points) Summarize Findings

- Identify which states share a common cluster. 
- For a given cluster, what are its primary characteristics 

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

cluster 1: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas
cluster 2: California, Colorado, Connecticut
cluster 3: Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho
cluster 4: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi
cluster 5: Missouri
cluster 6: Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico
cluster 7: New York
cluster 8: North Carolina
cluster 9: North Dakota, Ohio
cluster 10: Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas 
cluster 11: Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin
cluster 12: Wyoming

Each cluster has the attributes found in `names(climate.df)` minus "state", "capital", "st", "labels" and attributes for snow (unless included). Each attribute corresponds to a bar on the "circle" of a cluster. Once all the states are grouped together, they are compared to each other to show how similar they are. Larger values are longer and stick out more. Additionally, more variation between these attributes causes the bars to more spread out around the center of the circle.

</pre>

[ Summarize your k-means findings for 12 clusters. ]




## (15 points) Correlation

Correlation, like distance, is an important feature of multivariate analysis.  So let's review some basic correlation related to our climate data.  For simplicity, let's consider "Record High Temperature" and "Record Low Temperature" and see how they correlate with other factors we have gathered from Wikipedia.

Recall, in this table, "Jan-Dec" are different months of the same temperature variable.  

```{r, chunk-correlations-high, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(Hmisc); # p-values for correlation

high = subsetDataFrame(climate, c("key", "units"), "==", c("Record high F (C)", 1));
high = merge(high, capitals, by=c("capital","state"));

high.X = high[,c(5:18,21)]; # numeric data
high.cor = round( cor(high.X), digits=2);
# high.cor.p = rcorr(as.matrix(high.X), type="pearson");  # p-values for statistical significance
# str(high.cor.p);
# examine July (idx = 7)

as.data.frame( high.cor ) ; # so it will render nicely in RStudio

high.cor.july = high.cor[,7]; #show how well each month corr to month 7 (July)
high.cor.july;

high.cor.lat = high.cor[,13]; #show how well each month corr to latitude
high.cor.lat;
```

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

- July perfectly correlates with July (1.00, strong positive) because they are the same data. This is true when every month is compared to itself. 
- All the months are medium to highly positively correlated with each other (almost all of them ranging between .41 and .92).
- latitude is a measure of location (+north/-south) so the correlation value is not really accurate since we are comparing a location to the record high temperature in a month. However, July's correlation to latitude is (-.15) which may imply that its location is slightly southern from the equator.
- longitude is a measure of location (+east/-west) so the correlation value is not really accurate since we are comparing a location to the record high temperature in a month. However, July's correlation to longitude is (.02) which may imply that its location is very slightly east of the prime meridian.
- population is a measure of the size of a city, thus making its correlation value also inaccurate.
- Because July doesn't have a positive correlation with latitude, I would say months that are less correlated to July would be more correlated to latitude, like January (.25) and December (.27). Months that have a higher correlation to July would be less correlated to latitude, like June (.9) and August (.91). Because all the other month's correlations to July are positive, I would say all the month's correlations to latitude would be negative (confirmed by high.cor.lat table).

</pre>

Describe the correlation of July in "Record high F (C)" to the other numeric factors printed above. 

**x is correlated with y (0.00).  This correlation is positive/negative which means ...  This correlation is strong/weak because ... overall, this suggests ... **

- July perfectly correlates with July (1.00). This correlation is positive and very strong. This is because they are the same data.
- With the months, you can note each, or plot a trend showing them, and discussing them briefly as a trend.
- latitude is a measure of north/south, so be certain to apply the correlation value with some meaning. Be certain you know which direction is positive or negative to correctly interpret the sign of the correlation.
- longitude is a measure of east/west, so be certain ...
- population is the size of the city
- Intuitively, which months do you think correlate most with latitude for this data? Which correlate the least? Is the correlation always the same sign (positive/negative), or does it change? [You can use the dataframe output to do this analysis, or create your own subset]

```{r, chunk-correlations-low, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

library(Hmisc); # p-values for correlation

low = subsetDataFrame(climate, c("key", "units"), "==", c("Record low F (C)",1));
low = merge(low, capitals, by=c("capital","state"));

low.X = low[,c(5:18,21)]; # numeric data
low.cor = round( cor(low.X), digits=2);
# low.cor.p = rcorr(as.matrix(low.X), type="pearson");  # p-values for statistical significance
# str(low.cor.p);
# examine Jan (idx = 1)

as.data.frame( low.cor ) ; # so it will render nicely in RStudio

low.cor.january = low.cor[,1]; #show how well each month corr to month 1 (January)
low.cor.january;

low.cor.lat = low.cor[,13]; #show how well each month corr to latitude
low.cor.lat;
```

Describe the correlation of January in "Record low F (C)" to the other numeric factors printed above. 
<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

- January perfectly correlates with January (1.00, strong positive) because they are the same data. This is true when every month is compared to itself. 
- All the months are highly positively correlated with each other (all of them ranging between .7 and .97).
- latitude is a measure of location (+north/-south) so the correlation value is not really accurate since we are comparing a location to the record low temperature in a month. However, January's correlation to latitude is (-.75) which may imply that its location is far south of the equator.
- longitude is a measure of location (+east/-west) so the correlation value is not really accurate since we are comparing a location to the record low temperature in a month. However, January's correlation to longitude is (-.33) which may imply that its location is west of the prime meridian.
- population is a measure of the size of a city, thus making its correlation value also inaccurate.
- Because January doesn't have a positive correlation with latitude, I would say months that are less correlated to July would be more correlated to latitude, like and August (.77) and July (.74). Months that have a higher correlation to January would be less correlated to latitude, like February (.95) and December (.97). Because all the other month's correlations to January are strongly positive, I would say all the month's correlations to latitude would be strongly negative (confirmed by low.cor.lat table).

</pre>

Similar to "high" write up, but for the "low" data.




## "So What" is DATA ANALYSIS?

In the social sciences (e.g., Karl Weick), the concept of "sense making" refers to "the process by which people give meaning to their collective experiences".  I have used this framework in my high-technology innovation research (See Figure 1 of <http://www.mshaffer.com/arizona/pdf/LoneGenius.pdf>, my rubric concept comes from learning-theory growth models:  Nascent, Adolescent, Mature.) 

This final topic is reflective:  we are thinking about how we think.

### Statistics

The syllabus defined statistics as "the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation and presentation of data." (See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics>)

There are 5 elements mentioned:  collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of "data".  Are those equally weighted?  That is, should we devote 20% of our time to each of those?  Now, consider the "analysis" stage.  I have suggested there are two camps:  exploratory and confirmatory data analysis.  Are those equally weighted?  That is, should we devote 50% of our time to each of those?  Now, in an "equally-likely" scenario, we would have.

```{r, chunk-conclusion-equally-likely, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = c(20,20,10,10,20,20);
x.labels = c("collection", "organization", "EDA analysis", "CDA analysis", "interpretation", "presentation");
x.colors = c("blue", "lightgreen", "green", "darkgreen", "orange", "red");

barplot(x, 
        col = x.colors,
        ylim = c(0, 20),
        ylab = "Proportion: (Sums to 100)",
        main="Statistics as the Study of 'Data'");


text(1.14* (1:6), par("usr")[3], col = x.colors, labels = x.labels, srt = 45, adj = c(1.1,1.1), xpd = TRUE, cex=.75);
```

### Data Analytics

<IMG src="http://md5.mshaffer.com/WSU_STATS419/_images_/data-analytics.png" style="border: 2px black solid;" />
<div>**Source: https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/197-2/ ** (Accessed October 2010) </div>

"Data analytics is the application of powerful new methods—drawn from computer science, mathematics and statistics, and domain sciences—to collect, curate, analyze, discover and communicate knowledge from 'big data'." <https://data-analytics.wsu.edu/> (Accessed October 2010)


#### Importance of 'Data'

I love data.  

I also love math/physics.  I also love exploratory data analysis.  I also love computational statistics or statistical computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics>.  I also love thinking about developing the one graphic to summarize data most effectively.

#### Apprenticeship as Learning a Trade
The idea of sharing in the learning process is an important aspect of the apprenticeship model.  You are learning a trade (data analytics).  I have experience in this trade.  My job as the instructor is to provide you with a variety of "situated-learning" experiences To help you understand the nature of the trade.   This exam is an example of such an experience.

#### Tools of the Trade

Below are the core requirements for the data analytics program:

* Calculus and linear algebra (10 credits)
* Computer science fundamentals (11 credits)
* Machine learning and data management (9 credits)
* Statistics (15 credits)
* Data analytics introduction, ethics & project-focused * capstone experience (9 credits)

These are not the tools of the trade, but hopefully, they introduce you to key tools of the trade.  What exactly are tools of the trade? [You will have an opportunity to write a response below.]

#### Dimensional Reduction, an Axiomatic View

This video was recently shared with me that highlights some distinctions among persons practicing various forms of data analysis <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHGlCi9jOWY>.  As an orthogonal projection, I would create two axes.  On the horizontal axis (x-axis), I would place "theory of data" to the left and "application of data" toward the right.  On the vertical axis (y-axis), I would place "care for data integrity" at the top and "less care for data integrity" at the bottom.

#### Skills of the Trade

As someone that is coming from industry, having hired young people like you out of Computer Science, Electrical-Computer Engineering, I have opinions related to skills of the trade.

* Can you acquire an appreciation for "data intimacy"?
* Can you track and document how data is curated?
* Can you track and document the analyses you perform?  Can you recreate them?  Do you have basic version-control protocols in place?
* Can you view data from multiple perspectives and synthesize those perspectives to identify the central theme of the data?  Can you be objective?  Can you try and identify objective metrics to enlighten your understanding about the essence of data?
* Can you experiment with different visualizations in search of an optimal "one graphic" result?  Do you have practice using various visualization tools?  Can you comprehend which visualization tool is appropriate for messaging (communicating results) to a particular audience?
* Can you communicate and defend your findings to a particular audience?  Are your communications professional?  Is the final work product both simple and comprehensive:  simple in its summary findings and comprehensive in its ability to be replicated and audited as necessary.

## (20 points) YOUR OPINION OF DATA ANALYTICS 

This is worth 20 points.

Specifically, address: 

(1) what proportion of "statistics" should be divided among: collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of "data" ... providing a `barplot` of your opinion within your response would seem appropriate

```{r, chunk-conclusion-student-perspective, cache.rebuild=TRUE}

x = c(23,17,13,9,17,21);  ## change these values and discuss why
x.labels = c("Collection", "Organization", "ED Analysis", "CD Analysis", "Interpretation", "Presentation");
x.colors = c("blue", "lightgreen", "green", "darkgreen", "orange", "red");

barplot(x, 
        col = x.colors,
        ylim = c(0, 25),
        xlab = "Elements of Statistics",
        ylab = "Proportion: (Sums to 100)",
        main="Statistics as the Study of 'Data'");

text(1.14* (1:6), par("usr")[3], col = x.colors, labels = x.labels, srt = 45, adj = c(1.1,1.1), xpd = TRUE, cex=.70);
```

(2) what tools of the trade should you be acquiring from the core courses?  how are you doing in that acquisition process (e.g., tool X is ... and right now I feel like my understanding/proficiency of tool X ... ) ... 

(3) utilize the provided `plot` script to place the coure-course categories on the proposed x-y graph related to analytics practice (Applied vs Theoretical) and care of data integrity (Great Care vs Little Care) ... Also place your personal assessment on the plot script provided

(3) evaluate your skill-level on the six "skills of the trade":  Emerging (Nascent), Developing (Adolescent), Mastering (Mature).  explain your evaluation and include other important skills you believe are relevant that are not included

(4) Any other comments you would like to share.

<pre style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: #717171; border: 2px solid #981e32;">

(1) See bar plot above. I think the most time should be spent collecting the data. This ensures that you have high-quality data, that is complete and error-free as possible. The second most time and effort should be put into the presentation of the data. The whole point of statistics and big data is to learn from the data and share it with others. If your audience doesn't understand what you are presenting, then the entire process was pointless. Organization and Interpretation should be given equal importance, because structure and understanding of the data is quite important, but doesn't usually require as much time as Collection or Presentation. As I stated in 2.3, I believe Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Confirmatory Data Analysis (CDA) both have their roles in statistics, but EDA is more valuable and was given more importance.

(2) Some tools I should be acquiring from the core courses are programming languages (R, Python, C/C++), database management systems (XML, SQL), and software (Anaconda, RStudio, Git). My current proficiency with R and C/C++ is quite good, but my courses don't include formal teaching of Python, and I feel like I'm lacking proper knowledge of Python and its libraries. My current proficiency with XML is almost non-existent and zero with SQL. I just started learning XML last week in Cpts 415 and I have had zero exposure to SQL. Nairanjana Dasgupta (Jan) has mentioned many times that SQL is important to learn and that it comes too late in the Data Analytics courses. My current proficiency with RStudio is great, I believe I really know how to use it well and could teach others. Anaconda and Git not so much. But I have learned a lot about Git during this class and so my understanding and knowledge of it have gone up drastically.

Some learning tools I should be acquiring from the core courses are math, computer science, machine learning, statistics, data analytics, data visualization. My current proficiency in math and data analytics are excellent. I've always been good at math and I enjoy doing it. My current proficiency in computer science, statistics, and data visualization is good, but I still have more to learn. My current proficiency in machine learning is low. I struggled to implement the subject and each of my teachers have a different way of teaching it.

(3) See plot script below.

(4) - Can you acquire an appreciation for “data intimacy”? 

Mature: I know a lot about the usefulness of results and am very familiar with what good data looks like.
 
 - Can you track and document how data is curated? 

Mature: I have learned a lot about the ethics of collecting, storing, and tracking data.
 
 - Can you track and document the analyses you perform? Can you recreate them? Do you have basic version-control protocols in place? 

Adolescent: I am familiar with documenting and recreating analyses, but version-control is new to me.
 
 - Can you view data from multiple perspectives and synthesize those perspectives to identify the central theme of the data? Can you be objective? Can you try and identify objective metrics to enlighten your understanding about the essence of data?

Nascent & Adolescent: I believe I can do all of the above, but I haven't had that much experience with doing so.
 
 - Can you experiment with different visualizations in search of an optimal “one graphic” result? Do you have practice using various visualization tools? Can you comprehend which visualization tool is appropriate for messaging (communicating results) to a particular audience?
 
Adolescent & Mature: visualizations are my thing. I have enjoyed learning about, experimenting with, and specializing in displays of data. I feel like I can learn more overall and with searching for an optimal graph.
 
 - Can you communicate and defend your findings to a particular audience? Are your communications professional? Is the final work product both simple and comprehensive: simple in its summary findings and comprehensive in its ability to be replicated and audited as necessary.

Nascent & Adolescent: this is an area where my courses have been lacking, and therefore my experience with, is lacking. Most of the time this part of data analytics is only done through projects. Though I'm currently working on one, I have only completed 1 project.

(5) Thinking about how we think is always interesting, I'd be interested to see how other people answered this section.
