In
this
section,
we
review
the
regression
results
to
summarize
our
findings.
First,
we
examine
each
model
for
significance,
and
conclude
the
hypothesized
models
fit
well
with
the
data.
Second,
we
conclude
that
the
fixed
country
effects
represent
consistent
and
unbiased
parameter
estimates.
Third,
with
the
use
of
the
\citet
{Driscoll:1998}
robust
standard
errors,
we
adjust
any
variance
bias
to
ascertain
the
significance
of
these
consistent
estimates.
Therefore,
we
are
able
to
make
inferences
about
the
hypotheses
using
our
model
estimates.
For
ease
of
interpretation
across
these
12
models,
we
introduce
$\betaSH
{{
\
\
}M1}{Total}{1}$
as
notation
to
refer
to
parameter
estimate
$\hat
{\beta
}_{1}$
(HDI)
for
the
Total
Sample
and
(M1)
Model
1:
Main
Effects.
We
proceed
by
reporting
findings
for
the
total
sample.
